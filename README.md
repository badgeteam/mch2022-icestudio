# Icestudio examples

Icestudio is an IDE to work with FPGAs easily.

It is a very good tool to introducing you in the Open Source FPGA tools and for advanced users with very less friction.

You can download Icestudio from [https://downloads.icestudio.io](https://downloads.icestudio.io)

MCH22 Badge is only supported in the latest WIP versions, dont worry about it. WIP versions are very stable and count with the latest features.

Icestudio is a visual editor, you develop your FPGA circuits with blocks and verilog, depends of your skills.

In Icestudio "libraries" are named "Collections", you could install collections with a lot of blocks (PWM, motors, control leds, RiscV, Z80 processor...)

You can downloading [https://github.com/FPGAwars/Collection-Jedi](https://github.com/FPGAwars/Collection-Jedi) that count with a lot of blocks.

In Icestudio Wiki  are install instructions and a lot of collections sources:
