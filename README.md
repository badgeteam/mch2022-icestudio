# Welcome to the Icestudio Getting Started Guide, MCH2022 edition!

![Icestudio & MCH22 Badge](/images/mch22-splash.jpg?raw=true)

Icestudio is a design tool focused on newcomers to the FPGA world. 

Icestudio started as an easy development process for open source FPGAs. But
today a number of advanced FPGA developers use it, too, mixing traditional 
workflows with the easy flow of the drag and drop Icestudio IDE.

We are working on very powerful new features that will be deployed in the
course of 2022.

You'll find a number of examples to play with on your Badge and learn FPGA
development. If you are a newbie to FPGAs or Icestudio, explore it!

You can download Icestudio from [Icestudio download
page](https://downloads.icestudio.io)

Please always download always latest `wip` release (the most recent binaries)
and don't worry, Icestudio WIPs are very stable and contain the latest
features..

In the case of the MCH2022 Badge you need to install python3 on your
computer. Check the Getting Started Guide of the badge [at the official
website](https://badge.team/docs/badges/mch2022/getting-started/)

## What can I do with Icestudio?

The short answer is: anything you want... your mind is your limit. Here are
some step-by-step instructions for playing with your badge making incredible
things: 


* **Step 1**: Draw your circuit
