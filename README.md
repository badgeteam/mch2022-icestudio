# Welcome to the Icestudio getting starting guide at MCH2022!

![Icestudio & MCH22 Badge](/images/mch22-splash.jpg?raw=true)

Icestudio is a design tool focused on new comers to the FPGA world. 

This tool started as an easy way to introducing the development proccess of open source FPGAs but today a lot of advanced FPGA developers use it, mixing traditional ways of work with the easy flow of the drag and drop Icestudio IDE.

We are working in very powerful new features that will be deployed along 2022.

In this repository you could find some examples to play and learn FPGAs with your badge. If you are a newby with FPGAs or with Icestudio, explore it!

You can download Icestudio from [Icestudio download page](https://download.icestudio.io)

Download always the latest wip (the most recent binaries) and dont worry, Icestudio WIPs are very stables and contains the latest features..

In the case of the MCH22 Badge you need to have installed python3 in your computer. Check the getting starter guide of the badge [at the official website](https://badge.team/docs/badges/mch2022/getting-started/)

## What i could do with Icestudio?

Definitively, all of you want... your mind is your limit. In single steps you will be playing with your badge making incredible things. You only:


* **Step 1**: Draw your circuit

* **Step 2**: Upload it to your Badge, only pressing a button. 

* **Step 3**: Done! üòÄÔ∏è


### Install it and try! you could start with [our Icestudio starter guide](starter-guide/01_setup.md)

but firts of all setup your badge, you should read the [official badge getting started](https://badge.team/docs/badges/mch2022/getting-started/).
