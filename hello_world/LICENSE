This repository contains a variety of cores and example projects.
In general here I target the CERN-OHL-P-2.0 for the HDL and MIT for
the software. The full text for those license should be under the
`doc/` subdirectory.

Some code imported from elsewhere might be under different licenses.
This repository also contains submodules that are licensed under their
own licenses.

Each file/project/core has the applicable license in its header, make
sure to check them.
