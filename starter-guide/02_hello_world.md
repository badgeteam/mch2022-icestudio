You will see your Badge change to FPGA mode, loading the bitstream and start
executing with the bitstream loaded. Don't forget, the bitstream is not a
program that is executing, it's a new hardware circuit that you created...

When the bitstream finishes loading, the RGB LED turns on and alternates its
color.
