# Installation

Install Icestudio is very easy, you only need to download your OS package from:

https://downloads.icestudio.io

## Some tips

* For Linux users, take the **zip** package because **appImage** format has security problems with the badge usb subsystem (we are working to fix it).

* Linux zip packages contain ** a second zip package **, unzip again. This is generated by github artifacts packager and is a little confused.

* You need to setup first  your MCH2022Badge, [here the installation guide](https://badge.team/docs/badges/mch2022/getting-started/).

* In each case you need to have installed Python 3 in your system and in your PATH.
